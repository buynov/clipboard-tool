Clipboard Tool
==============

This is a project I initially [shared on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clipboard-tool/) several years ago.

This tool requires Java 1.6, due to the system tray support and has two main features:
  * Transliteration from and to cyrillic text (i.e. if you are concerned that the cyrillic characters might not be displayed on the recepient's side)
  * Removal of formatting from the text in the clipboard (so that you can paste is as plain text and to allow it to adopt the format of the destination document)

I guess it could be useful if you are interested in working with the system tray from Java and/or handle text in the clipboard.
